# Intro

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub Profile. I love software. I love the projects I build dearly and it brings me joy to share them with the world! 

This is my attempt at guiding you through some of the work I have done over the years. I hope you enjoy my work!

## DPS Telecom Portfolio
Some projects I developed as a Software Engineer at DPS Telecom. I decided to display my work by organizing and processing GIFs of applications I built.
